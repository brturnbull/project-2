# WDI Project 2: InstaSpam

---

### Overview
This was our first look into Full Stack Development. I will admit I was a bit nervous about the idea but it ultimately piqued my interest in server side technologies. The finished product was a fully RESTful web application in which users could securely create an account and login, then upload, view, edit, delete and comment on pictures that had been uploaded. The name came from the idea that all the content would be inspired by “Spam” the canned meat, and was a parody version of the Instagram application.

### Challenges
The biggest challenge here was definitely moving to such a new and seemingly complex file structure. Until now my work had been written mainly across three files, so I will admit I found the whole concept a little daunting and at times confusing. I chose to just take my time with this and make sure I understood not just what files were linked but also how and why. I also had to make sure I was careful with my naming conventions and commenting through the code.


### Wins
The authentication on this project was something I really enjoyed working with. I've found that quite interesting from day one so being able to implement that in my own project was quite cool.

I really enjoyed working with server side technologies on this project, as well. As we only had 4 days covering EJS, authentication and MongoDB prior to starting the project I think the biggest win in the project was that I got to get my hands dirty and solidify what I had learned in such a short period of time.

## Future features
One thing I want to prioritise for future features is implementation of Filestack so that users can upload from their computer or phone rather than submitting a link to an image. I think that would make such a massive difference to the user experience.
